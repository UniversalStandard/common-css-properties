# @universalstandard/common-css-properties

`yarn add @universalstandard/common-css-properties`

There are [1,000+](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/all-properties.en.json) CSS properties. Most of them are useless. These are the ones we use.

This package was initially created to be used in conjunction with [@universalstandard/ook](https://github.com/universalstandard/ook) for performance so each prop only needs to sift through an array of 100+ CSS properties rather than 1,000+.

It was originally based off of common CSS properties listed on [MDN here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Properties_Reference), but as we use properties, we'll add them to this list.

Please PR properties you use. It's an easy process and a quick merge. üòÅ
